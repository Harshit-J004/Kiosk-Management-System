Yes, Harshit — you can absolutely make this your **README.md** file on GitHub. In fact, it’s a **perfect showcase** of your project’s architecture, agentic flow, and technical depth.

## ✅ How to Use It as README

### 1. **Create a file named `README.md`** in your project root (same level as `kiosk_crew.py`)

### 2. Paste the cleaned and formatted version of the documentation I gave you (see below)

### 3. Commit + push to GitHub:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add detailed project documentation"
git push
```

## 📘 Here’s the Markdown Version (Ready to Paste)

I’ve formatted this for GitHub, including headings, bullet points, flow diagrams, and code blocks.

# 🧠 Multi-Store Kiosk Agentic AI System

> A fully autonomous, agent-powered multi-store kiosk manager using CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses **agentic AI** to automate diagnostics, maintenance, order tracking, and alert responses across multiple store kiosks. Built with a clean modular architecture using:

- 🧠 CrewAI
- 🔧 Custom LangChain Tools
- 🤖 LLMs like GPT-3.5 / GPT-4
- 🛠️ CLI Interface for Supervisor Control

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```

\[ User ]
│
▼
\[ Main CLI App ]         ← L0: Supervisor
│
▼
\[ EnhancedSupervisor ]   ← L0
├─ OperatorApp for store001  ← L1
├─ OperatorApp for store002
└─ OperatorApp for store003

Each OperatorApp:
├─ Kiosk Specialist Agent     ← L2
├─ Order Specialist Agent
└─ Alert Specialist Agent

Each Agent uses:
└─ Enhanced Tool (\_run logic) ← L3

```

---

## ⚙️ Key Components

### 🔹 `EnhancedSupervisor`
- Controls all store operator apps
- Manages monitoring, operations, maintenance, restarts

### 🔹 `EnhancedOperatorApp`
- Handles all agentic logic for a specific store
- Creates CrewAI agent groups (diagnostic, ops, alerts)

### 🔹 CrewAI Agents
- Kiosk Specialist
- Order Specialist
- Alert Specialist
- Each with attached tool & reasoning LLM

### 🔹 Tools
- `EnhancedKioskTool` → handles kiosk health, status, restarts
- `EnhancedOrderTool` → tracks orders, priorities
- `EnhancedAlertTool` → resolves system alerts

## 🔄 Flow Diagram: Full AI Ops (Option 3)

```

User selects option 3: Run Full AI Operations
↓
Supervisor.run\_full\_operations()
↓
For each store:
├─ run\_diagnostics()
│   └─ CrewAI executes kiosk agent → \_run("diagnostic store001")
└─ run\_operations()
└─ CrewAI executes order agent → \_run("process orders store001")

````

## 🧩 Crew + Task Design

```python
Crew(
  agents=[Agent1, Agent2],
  tasks=[
    Task(
      description="diagnostic store001",
      agent=Agent1
    ),
    Task(
      description="process orders store001",
      agent=Agent2
    )
  ],
  process=Process.sequential,
  verbose=True
)
````

## 📊 Sample Tool Triggers

| Tool      | Query                 | Description                    |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| KioskTool | `diagnostic store001` | Runs health checks             |
| OrderTool | `process orders`      | Tracks and fulfills orders     |
| AlertTool | `resolve alerts`      | Handles critical system alerts |

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install crewai langchain-openai python-dotenv
```

### Set Your OpenAI Key

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

And in code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

---

## 🔧 LLM Setup (OpenAI GPT)

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
  model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature=0.3
)
```

---

## ✅ Features

* 🔄 Restart store systems
* 🧠 AI-powered diagnostics
* 📦 Order operations
* 🚨 Alert handling
* 📊 Latency tracking
* 📋 Real-time kiosk status

---

## 🧠 Agentic AI Modes

| Mode                 | `expected_output` Used? | LLM Planning? | Tool Used? |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Tool-Only (fast)     | ❌                       | ❌             | ✅ Yes      |
| Full Agent Reasoning | ✅                       | ✅ GPT Plans   | ✅ Optional |
